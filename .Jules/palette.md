# Palette's Journal - Critical UX/A11y Learnings

## 2024-05-22 - [Initial Setup]
**Learning:** This is a CLI/Python library project, not a web app. UX focus is on Developer Experience (DX), CLI clarity (emojis, progress), and visualization quality.
**Action:** Apply CLI best practices (emojis, flush=True) and improve matplotlib visualizations (side-by-side comparisons) in example scripts.
